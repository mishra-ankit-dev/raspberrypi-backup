# RPi based automated Toll-collection system

this project deals with the checking for the validation of customer RFID card and then updating the three database files.                     
1 : change.csv => It stores the customers' name and their updated balance.          
2 : customer.csv => It is the main database to store all the important details of the customer and the tag is checked from this file.    
3 : check in.csv => It stores the information about the time when the customer crosses the toll.
